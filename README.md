        For players who are fighting a slice, Big Bertha brings game changing technologies off the tee. A low and forward CG helps to reduce the spin that can cause a slice. Big Bertha also utilizes weight in the heel to promote hitting a draw.
        Big Bertha’s XL Face features a large sweet spot and uses cutting edge A.I. technology to optimize speed and spin across the face.
        <p>
        An all-new lightweight Jailbreak system has been enhanced to deliver stability and incredibly fast ball speeds across the face.
        With a generously stretched profile and large, forgiving head shape, Big Bertha inspires confidence and promotes incredible forgiveness.
        Featuring a triaxial carbon crown and lightweight components, Big Bertha is designed from the ground up to be easy-to-swing.
